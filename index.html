          A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than
          researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover has been
          <a
            href="/article/2197638-curiosity-is-entering-what-may-be-the-best-area-to-find-life-on-mars/"
            >exploring Gale crater</a
          >
          for more than eight years, and while early observations suggested the
          entire crater may once have been filled with water, a new analysis
          implies that it just had a series of ponds instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a
          measure called the chemical index of alteration to determine how rocks
          were weathered over time.
          <a href="https://www.clays.space/">Joseph Michalski</a> at the
          University of Hong Kong and his colleagues have suggested that because
          this measure was developed for use on Earth, it may not be valid in
          the extreme Martian climate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds that
          are expected to change based on different types of weathering over
          time. They found that some of the layers of rock Curiosity examined
          did interact with water at some point in their past, but more are
          likely to have formed outside of the water.

          “Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers that
          are demonstrably lacustrine [formed in a lake] are the lower few
          metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the
          fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per
          cent.”
        </p>
        <p>
          These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of
          <a
            href="/article/2271407-marss-crust-may-have-sucked-up-most-of-the-planets-water/"
            >sediments in the crater</a
          >, suggesting the lake was not nearly as deep or extensive as we
          thought. “There was likely a small lake or more likely a series of
          small lakes in the floor of Gale crater, but these were shallow
          ponds,” says Michalski.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic, so
          Michalski says that they may have formed out of ash from volcanic
          eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up. Observations by
          other Mars missions have hinted that these sediments were deposited by
          wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch.
